The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded one-half to Dr. Rainer Weiss and one-half split between Dr. Barry Barish and Dr. Kip Thorne for successfully detecting and measuring gravitational waves in LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and VIRGO (another Laser Interferometer named after the Virgo cluster). The LIGO project has been in the works for more than 40 years and, as Weiss clarified in an interview with the Nobel Committee, the prize can be viewed as a recognition of the work of thousands of people. Scientists around the world project that the ability to measure gravitational waves will open up an entirely new field of astrophysics, allowing for the observation of distant celestial events in an entirely novel way.

The existence of gravitational waves was predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of General Relativity, and few were surprised by LIGO’s confirmation in 2015. In fact, the existence of gravitational waves was first proved in 1974 by Dr. Russell Hulse and Dr. Joseph Taylor by examining a binary pulsar, a project that in fact earned Hulse and Taylor the 1993 Nobel Prize. A pulsar is a rapidly rotating, extremely dense neutron star that emits beams of extremely powerful electromagnetic radiation. Because the beam is quite narrow and far more powerful than the radiation emitted by the rest of the star, more radiation is detected when the beams are pointed at earth. These “pulses” of radiation from pulsars yield information about the star including its rotational speed, motion relative to earth (via the Doppler effect), and orbital period. Hulse and Taylor observed a system of two pulsars that orbited each other, called a binary pulsar. The physicists made many discoveries and observations, but most notably, they noticed that the rotational period of the system decreased by 75 millionths of a second over the course of a year. Though the decrement seems miniscule, it indicated that the stars being observed were slowly moving closer together and orbiting their combined center of mass more quickly. Hulse and Taylor hypothesized that the faster rotation was due to a loss of energy from gravitational waves that the system was emitting. The theoretical amount of this “gravitational radiation” matched almost exactly the amount of energy that the system was losing each year, supporting the argument that gravitational waves exist. However exciting, this revelation was predicted and revealed relatively little information about the gravitational waves aside from how much energy they contained.

The laser interferometer employed in LIGO is an ingenious device that measures gravitational waves far more directly: it utilizes the consequence of the theory of general relativity, which dictates that acceleration–and therefore gravity–causes distortions in spacetime.

While the speed of light is constant in each frame of reference, light can experience a relativistic “drag” when traveling through severely distorted spacetime. During this phenomenon, light can appear to travel more slowly than normal from an external frame of reference, even though the instantaneous velocity is the same as always. In such a way, a straight line can actually be curved and distorted from an outside perspective, making it appear as though the light has a longer path, and thus a lower net velocity than normal. Another important quality of light is that it exhibits interference patterns; sensing the interference of two beams of light can yield information about the waveforms of the interacting light. But if these are known to be the same, the position of one “wave” of light relative to another can be concluded. In the laser interferometer, one laser (a beam in which each photon has identical energy and frequency) was split into two separate beams, each traveling 4 kilometers in separate directions and being repeatedly reflected back and forth within tubes. Finally, the two beams recombined into one beam of light, which traveled to a photosensor. This sensor is able to detect the interference pattern of the two recombined beams of light. The only way to change the interference pattern is to make one beam of light travel further than the other, since the amplitudes and frequencies remain identical. For example, shifting one sinusoidal wave function relative to another, otherwise identical wave, and then adding these two functions to form a third, net waveform: if the peak of one wave aligns with the trough of the other, the two waves will interfere destructively and result in no signal, whereas greater synchronization between the waves will result in a sum wave with a greater amplitude. If the LIGO sensor detects a shift in the interference, it can be concluded that one tunnel is temporarily lengthened or shortened relative to the other in terms of length or in terms of the rate at which time passes within that tunnel. Under the gravitational wave model, one of these two perpendicular tunnels will have to be more parallel to the spread of the gravitational waves, which spread at the speed of light. The tunnel that is parallel to the spread of the gravitational wave will alternately be expanded and compressed in length because the spacetime distortion will force photons in that tunnel to first travel a greater distance, and then a lesser distance.  As a result, the sensor will detect a disturbance, which can be used to judge how strong and frequent the gravitational waves were.

The first successful test of the interferometer took place on September 14, 2015, when LIGO detected gravitational waves emanating from a pair of merging black holes. Not only did the experimental values match those that were theorized, but the predicted energy of the gravitational waves matched the difference between the combined masses of the separate black holes and the mass of the resultant black hole, when evaluated with Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence. 

The laser interferometer provides entirely new approaches to solving old physics challenges, such as discovering the point of incompatibility between Einstein’s theories of relativity and quantum theory, discovering more celestial events such as the collision of neutron stars and black holes, and better understanding what dark matter is. Some scientists suggest that future generations of interferometers will be capable of detecting gravitational waves originating from the inception of the universe itself, allowing us to see back to the beginning of time itself. The prospect of attacking these age-old problems from a new angle has thrown open the tantalizing enigma of the universe to physicists like never before.
